## Programming project: A* 

This project served as a refresher for the techniques involved in implementing a graph-search algorithm.
The A* algorithm is a version of Dijkstra's algorithm, which includes a heuristic estimation between nodes.

The implementation features a gui allowing the user to draw a maze for the algorithm to solve using the mouse.
Pressing spacebar will start the algorithm, preventing interaction until it is completed.
Pressing enter will reset the grid.
